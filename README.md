# UnlimitedAnvil

## Goal

This bukkit-plugins aims to remove the "too expensive" message given by anvils

## Background:
I run a Minecraft Server for friends and they quickly reached levels of enchanting where the anvil wouldn't allow more enchantments. Therefore it was requested to remove that limitation. Since I couldn't find any comparable plugin that does this, I decided to try to write my own.

## Known bugs:
Anvil still shows "too expensive", I believe thats a client thing, haven't found a way to get rid of it yet, it will work anyways and thats why you get the message about cost
