# UnlimitedAnvil

## Goal

This plugins aims to remove the "too expensive" message given by anvils

# Background
I run a Minecraft Server for friends and they quickly reached levels of enchanting where the anvil wouldn't allow more enchantments. Therefore it was requested to remove that limitation. Since I couldn't find any comparable plugin that does this, I decided to try to write my own.
